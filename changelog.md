## Playtest notes (11/22/2025):

Threaten endangered animals cumbersome 

Nautical Station should at the very least maybe let you blow up the thing you’re looking at 

Obsessed Engineer static ability better 

Obsessed Engineer could be at start of turn look at the top card of your deck, if it’s a machine you can order it 

Secret Agent Mook should only toss a card on onboarding, far too strong 

Attorney Near Law says something like “When an enemy targets you, you can change the target to another enemy. 
When an enemy targets one of your mooks, you can change the target to another one of your mooks.” 

Mind Control Device could let you toss any number of cards and hire that many token mooks 

More operations on mooks 

Octopus Trainer bad 

Dog should onboard as a token mook when it blows up instead of becoming a cyborg 

Death Metal Bard 

Hire Contractor should hire a token mook if you want? 

Buff Physicist should have a small buff to his operation 

Quickdraw Cowboy can be the dude who resolves an operation instantly 

Each archetype should have 1 new operation available that is assembling a blueprint with slight upside 

Mind Control Device “Steal target player” 

Kid’s Science Museum should say “your” 

Dragon Cosplayer boring and lame 

## Changelog (11/23/2025)

- Advantage Fabricator now says "two" instead of "2"

- Nautical Station now has `Operation Catapult Launch (14) — Blow up target machine.`

- Secret Agent Mook no longer tosses a card when it comes home

- Obsessed Engineer's specific ability now gives you decent card selection and free machines whenever enemies fabricate machines
- Faction operations now cost 10 across the board.
- "Assemble" now has a game meaning instead of being a wrapper description for tucking a card under a blueprint. To "assemble", you put a card from the top of your arsenal under one of your blueprints. Instances of assemble are now bolded across all cards.
- The faction ability section on faction cards no longer describes assembling, it's now in reminder text after the operation text, which is now simply "Assemble".

- Most Loyal Pup is now hired as a token mook that's a cyborg when it's blown up, instead of just saying it becomes one

- Kid's Science Museum loses the doubling of fabrication abilities, but its operation is slightly cheaper

- Quickdraw Cowboy now resolves one of your operations instantly when it onboards

- Freelance Reporter now also removes invincible from the target

- Dragon Cosplayer now doesn't tuck under itself but gets the bonus from every one of your cards, could be strong

- Inflict Harrowing Mutation now blows up with radiation

- Added new operations across several mooks so that each archetype now has 4 operations available among their 7 mooks, and 1 of those operations is a faction action with upside. This is a major boost in consistency for every deck combination.
    - Intern Engineer has a new faction action operation
    - Armored Mook has an operation to draw a card
    - Drone Pilot allows for living machines now and has an operation to hire a token mook 
    - Indomitable Mook now says its threat level can't change, and has an operation to blow up weaker mooks
    - Attorney Near Law reworked, can now only redirect mook targets among your own mooks and has an operation to make an opponent reveal their hand and you play a scheme from it
    - Gifted Programmer reworked, now is a unique mook with the same fabricate trigger but a powerful faction action operation 
    - Alan Horner has an operation to be Transport a Prefab on a stick
    - Finn Dorset has an operation to hire a token mook
    - Octopus Trainer reworked to be threat level 8, require 1 mook, and has a faction action operation
    - Skilled Therapist now has an operation to flip up one of your token mooks, most of the time players got little or no value from her static
    - Dragon Cosplayer gets bigger for all of your tucked cards and has an operation that lets you assemble if you want, or tuck any other card
    - Hazmat Trooper now has an operation to give his immunities to all of your mooks and mooks you onboard, to help counteract your own WMD Specialist 
    - Corrupt Officer now sends home target mook when it onboards, and has an operation that assembles and can draw potentially several cards

- Hire Contractor now has you choose to hire a mook and draw a card, or hire a token mook

- Sinister Academic's liquidation to start is now a cost.

- Removed references to being "blown up by an ability", since everything that can blow up something in this game is an ability (0-threat level mooks are just tossed)

- Death Metal Bard is now smaller to be in range of 5-TL removal, and liquidates itself instead of blowing up so you can't stop it.

- Threaten Endangered Animals now lets you play as many machines as you want as fast as you want, and if you don't play any machines you can draw a card.
